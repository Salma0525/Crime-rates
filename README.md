This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a project analyzing crime rates in the United States using the 2009 UC Irvine ‘Communities and Crime’ dataset. Multiple linear regression (MLR) techniques are applied in order to identify the most significant socio-economic and demographic predictors of crime rates. The goal is to develop a predictive model focusing on the most important factors influencing crime rates across the United States’ communities.
