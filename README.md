This repository contains assets for a project analyzing crime rates in the United States using the 2009 UC Irvine ‘Communities and Crime’ dataset. Multiple linear regression (MLR) techniques are applied to identify significant predictors of crime rates, focusing on socio-economic and demographic factors. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook explaining the model-building process. The goal is to develop a predictive model focusing on the key factors influencing crime rates across the United States' communities.
